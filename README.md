# Updating your system and installing and using applications

WSL2 is compatible with the Home, Pro, or Server editions of Windows but not
Windows' 10 S (although you can often upgrade to the Home edition for free).

## Check that your Windows system is compatible with Flatiron School’s requirements

When working on software, it is important that your computer and the software that you’re using are compatible with each other. In this step, we’ll ensure that you are able to install all the tools that you will need to complete the program.

### Action item: check your Windows system specifications

1. Open the “Settings” application using the “Start” menu
2. Select the “System” option
3. Select “About” at the bottom of the list
4. Scroll down to the “Windows specifications” heading
5. Check that your “Edition” is one of the following: Windows 10 Home, Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Server

## Check that your Windows system has enough space for Flatiron School’s requirements
